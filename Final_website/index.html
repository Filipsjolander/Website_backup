				Welcome!
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a research project with the aim of classifying different cases of Glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.	It is an unusually heterogenic type of cancer and shows up in many different forms. Our approach is to crowd source data about a collection of images, which we will feed to a model trying to assign coordinates fitting to the data. The images are photographs of brain slices infested with Glioblastoma, where the brains come from mice. </p>

			<p>
				In each of the three comparison windows, we have presented a default view of the slice closest to the point of injection. However, do not forget to zoom and pan the image in order to get a clearer view of the type of growth in that particular brain.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Thank you for your participation!

				Instructions:
			</P>
			<ol>
				<li>You will be provided three images of cases of Glioblastoma.</li>
				<li>Upon inspecting them, you will decide which case is the most <em>unlike</em> the others in terms of cancer growth. In practice, this will be the case exhibiting the most unique growth characteristics..</li>
				<li>You will then click on the corresponding button to select it.</li>
				<li>The process is done and will start over with three new images.</li>
