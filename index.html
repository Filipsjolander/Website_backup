				Welcome!
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a research project with the aim of classifying different cases of Glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.	It is an unusually heterogenic type of cancer and shows up in many different forms. Our approach is to crowd source data about a collection of images, which we will feed to a model trying to assign coordinates fitting to the data. The images will be photographs of brain slices infested with Glioblastoma, where the brains come from mice. </p>

			<p>
				This is an early version of the web client and in this iteration of the model we are still testing it. So in this stage we are trying to gather some data about skin cancers to test our model on. When looking at these upcoming pictures, pay extra attention to the colour, shape, and structure of each case.

				Thank you for your participation!

				Instructions:
			</P>
			<ol>
				<li>You will be provided three images of cases of skin cancer.</li>
				<li>Upon inspecting them, you will decide which image is the most <em>unlike</em> the others, i.e. you will chose the one you deem to be the odd one out.</li>
				<li>You will then click on the corresponding button to select it.</li>
				<li>The process is done and will start over with three new images.</li>
				</ol>
